# RemindCheatPackage
This package includes two functions that can aid forgetful people and cheaters.

# Remind_me function
This function allows you to remind you of a number of things you might forget.
Such as the date of deadline, a birthday, groceries and errands. 
You do not need the use an argument in the function, just enter remind_me() and the list will be provided.


# Cheat function
This function is very helpful if you are in the Programming course and trust my answers for assignment 3.1.
However, I will only help you with four questions, namely 1, 2, 7, and 10. 
You only have to put in the question number (in the form: "Q3.1.1"), and the solution will be provided.
